# Neighborhood Services Exchange Platform

## Description
Neighborhood Services Exchange Platform is a localized platform where neighbors can offer, exchange, or barter services. It leverages SQL databases to manage user profiles, service listings, reviews, transaction histories, and chat functionalities. The platform is built using HTML & CSS for the front-end and NodeJS for back-end functionalities including real-time notifications, location-based search, and user interactions. The integration of Google Maps API enhances localized search capabilities, and messaging APIs are utilized for effective communication.

## Vision Statement
For Local Consumers who need services, the Neighborhood Service Exchange is a marketplace that provides a safe and efficient environment to exchange services and goods. Unlike competitors like Nextdoor, our product focuses primarily on services, offering a more specialized and user-friendly experience.
